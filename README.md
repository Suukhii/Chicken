# Chicken and Egg Simulation

This Python code simulates the age-old question of which came first, the chicken or the egg. It defines three classes: `Chicken`, `Egg`, and `Pen`. The `Chicken` class represents a chicken, the `Egg` class represents an egg, and the `Pen` class simulates a pen where either an egg or a chicken is created randomly. The code demonstrates the process of hatching eggs and creating chickens.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).
2. Clone this repository or download the Python file.

## Usage

To run the simulation, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located. Run the following command:

```shell
python chicken.py
```

The code will print the process of creating chickens and hatching eggs. Each time the Pen class is instantiated, either an egg or a chicken will be randomly created. The output will show the sequence of "Egg" and "Hatch" statements indicating the creation and hatching process.

# Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can extend or modify the code:

- You can modify the Pen class to add additional features such as keeping track of the number of chickens and eggs in the pen.
- Implement a function that simulates the growth and aging of the chickens, introducing additional stages such as "Chick" and "Adult".
- Create a loop that runs the simulation for a specified number of iterations, allowing you to observe the statistical trends of chicken-to-egg ratio.

Feel free to experiment and customize the code according to your requirements.
